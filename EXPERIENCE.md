# Vibe Coding Experience – Replit Agent

## Tool Selection
I selected Replit Agent because it requires no installation and runs in the browser. It provides an integrated AI agent that can generate and edit code without switching tools.

## Development Process
I started by creating a basic HTML/JS project and asked the agent to implement a todo list. It generated the initial code. Then I tested and refined features through prompts and manual edits.

## Challenges and Solutions
The agent sometimes overcomplicated functions and missed localStorage updates. I simplified the code and ensured persistence by manually adjusting logic.

## Reflection
Vibe coding accelerated development dramatically. Instead of writing boilerplate, I focused on features and testing. It is useful for small projects and rapid prototypes, but still requires critical review.

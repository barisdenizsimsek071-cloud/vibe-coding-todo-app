## Part 2 – Comparative Analysis

Traditional code completion tools only predict the next tokens within the current file. They help typing faster but lack project-level understanding. Vibe coding tools go further by analyzing multiple files, recognizing structure, and executing multi-step instructions.

Copilot provides inline suggestions but still requires the developer to manually control where code is added. Vibe coding tools take more autonomy: they can scaffold entire pages, connect modules, and refactor across the project.

ChatGPT in a separate window forces the user to copy/paste code and describe context manually. Vibe coding tools remove this friction because they operate directly in the IDE and have access to the entire project.

Advantages of vibe coding tools include rapid prototyping, reduced boilerplate, and a smoother workflow. Downsides include hallucinations, unnecessary complexity, and dependence risk.

Autocomplete tools are best for experts who know exactly what they want. Copilot suits everyday coding tasks where inline suggestions help. Vibe coding tools are ideal for MVPs, student projects, and fast prototyping where speed matters more than perfect architecture.
